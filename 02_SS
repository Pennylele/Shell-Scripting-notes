Once you opened a file with vim you can insert text by typing i, for instance. If you want to save your file use :w (write) or :q (quit) or :wq (for write and quit) or :q! (quit and do not save). Sometimes you need to hit the ESC key to be able to type the commands.

QUESTION: how to change the encoding to uff-8? Vim?

ASCII is a subset of UTF-8, so all ASCII files are already UTF-8 encoded. The bytes in the ASCII file and the bytes that would result from "encoding it to UTF-8" would be exactly the same bytes. There's no difference between them, so there's no need to do anything.
It looks like your problem is that the files are not actually ASCII. You need to determine what encoding they are using, and transcode them properly.

e.g. 
iconv -f US-ASCII -t UTF-8 file.php > file-utf8.php
