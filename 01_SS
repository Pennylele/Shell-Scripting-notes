$ chmod 777 test
(“test” is the file. The file would have )
0 –Full permissions (Read, Write, Execute)
1 –Write and read
2 –Read and execute
3 –Read only
4 –Write and execute
5 –Write only
6 –Execute onlyadminadmin
7 –No permissions

So 4 is 7-4 =3 read
2 is 7-2 =5 write
1 is 7-1=6 execute
4 + 2 + 1 = 7
we have 3 different users, so 777 is the full access to the file.
In my opinion, 7-7=0 which is the full permission, so 777 is the full permission for all 3 different users.
so $ chmod 444 test
would be changing the file’s permission to read only.
